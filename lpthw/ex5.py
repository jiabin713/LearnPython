# 1. Change all the variables so there is no my_ in front of each one. Make sure you change the
# name everywhere, not just where you used = to set them.

name = 'Zed A. Shaw'
age = 35 # not a lie
height = 74 # inches
weight = 180 # lbs
eyes = 'Blue'
teeth = 'White'
hair = 'Brown'

print(f"Let's talk about {name}.")

print(f"He's {weight} pounds heavy.")
print("Actually that's not too heavy.")

# this line is tricky, try to get it exactly right
total = age + height + weight

# 2. Try to write some variables that convert the inches and pounds to centimeters and kilograms.
# Do not just type in the measurements. Work out the math in Python.

centimeters = inches * 2.54
kilograms = weight * 0.454
